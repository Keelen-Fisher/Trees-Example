# Trees-Example

## Review

## Linear Data Structures

- Linked Lists: Need to be able to traverse
- Stacks
- Queues

## Tree Overview

> Hierarchical - Need to have a root, and branch out from there.
> Trees can have k children nodes on for each node.

### Terminology

- k-ary: each node has up to "k" number of children
  - Examples: Family Tree, DOM
- binary tree: each node has up to 2 (and no more) children
- balanced; nodes are inserted from top to bottom and maximum of one partially filled
- leaf: node children
- edge:
- edge weight:
- path: the route taken from a starting node to an ending node (root  -> leaf)
- path weight: ask for clarification - can be generalized or tailored but an example could be the sum of all nodes from root to leaf
- binary search tree: sorted binary tree. Lesser values to the left larger to values to right. Impacts efficiency

## Traversals

### Depth First Traveral

> from root to leaf

- pre-order
- in-order
- post-order

be able to look at a tree diagram and just KNOW what the order would be

### Breadth First Traversal

> read all nodes on 1st level, then
